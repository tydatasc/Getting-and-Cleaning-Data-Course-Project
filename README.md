#1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
#3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
